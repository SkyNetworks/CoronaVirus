                    <summary>What is corona viruses?</summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as
                        Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19</p>

                    <summary>What is COVID-19?
                    </summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</summary>
                    <p class="text">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                        become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and
                        develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing
                        should seek medical attention.

                    <summary>How does COVID-19 spread?</summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets
                        land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
                        person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”

                <details>
                    <summary>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? </summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience
                        only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease? </summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not amain feature of the outbreak.
                        The ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.

                <details>
                    <summary>Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for COVID-19?</summary>
                    <p class="text">Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients
                        recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials.<br> The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19
                        are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing

                    <summary>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?</summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.
                        <br> SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003

                    <summary>Should I wear mask to protect myself</summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then
                        you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks wisely.
                        <br> We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover

                    <p class="text"><br>1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.<br> 2. Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and
                        water
                        <br> 3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.<br> 4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).<br> 5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).<br> 6. Place the mask to
                        your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.<br> 7. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
                        <br> 8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.<br> 9. Discard the mask
                        in a closed bin immediately after use.<br> 10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water. <br>

                    <p class="text"><br>The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates
                        will be updated as more data become available. </p>

                    </summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV
                        is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.<br> To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact
                        with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products. </p>

                    <p class="text"><br>While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person
                        coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.<br> We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID19 topics and will update as new findings are available. </p>

                    <summary>How long does the virus survive on surfaces?
                    </summary>
                    <p class="text"><br>It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may
                        persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).<br> If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple
                        disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

                    <p class="text"><br>Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature
                        is also low. </p>
